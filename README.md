# Set Up
A place to save some basic set up for new machines such as my .emacs and .profile

## Emacs

To set up Emacs the first time:
1) Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2) Install Emacs: `brew install --cask emacs`
3) Create a .emacs with the contents of the .emacs saved in this repo
4) Inside Emacs, install needed packages: `M-x package-install`
    * init-open-recentf
    * web-mode
    * undo-tree
    * goto-last-change
    * yafolding
